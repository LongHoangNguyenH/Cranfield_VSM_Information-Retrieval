certain critical velocity, and then diminishes .  with still further increase of speed, the resistance in shallow water ultimately becomes, and remains, less than that in deep water at the same speed

.  here, the use of the navier stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given by the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier stokes equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock structure and has free stream conditions as outer boundary conditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/ conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses, and heat conduction . for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier stokes equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for both the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the assumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful approximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged layer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere using the incipient merged layer approximation . results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear, and heat transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled sphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above the extrapolated boundary layer values in the viscous layer regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime . as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease . calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they are higher than the free stream total enthalpy,. and the stagnation point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy . for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the same quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated boundary layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction theory . a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and the behavior predicted by

insulating properties of the laminar compressible boundary layer . in some cooling problems associated with high energy flows it may be convenient to localize strongly the cooling, as for example by injecting a coolant through an upstream porous strip, and to depend on the insulating properties of the boundary layer to reduce, or to eliminate completely the need for further cooling on the surface downstream of the highly cooled section .  this upstream cooling technique may be of interest in connection with optical windows in hypersonic wind tunnels, and on radomes, wings, and bodies of high speed aircraft and missiles . in this paper a method for investigating the insulating properties of a laminar compressible boundary layer on a two  dimensional surface with zero heat transfer is presented .  the physical situation considered thus corresponds to the case in which the heat transfer downstream of the strongly cooled section is completely eliminated .  of practical concern is how the temperature of the uncooled surface varies in the downstream direction from its low initial value and thus how the low energy layer established by the upstream cooling insulates the downstream surface . the karman integral method extended to both the momentum and energy partial differential equations of the boundary layer has been used .  the station, at which cooling and or injection ceases, corresponds to a discontinuity in boundary conditions and thus in solutions .  at this point the flux of mass, momentum, and energy within the boundary layer has been made continuous by the introduction of three additional parameters in the velocity and stagnation enthalpy profiles .  thus the velocity and stagnation enthalpy profiles have both been taken as sixth degree polynomials .

pinkerton employed the measured circulation to determine the pressure distribution and found that the resulting prediction of the moment is considerably improved over that given by the classical theory . this amounts to replacing the conventional kutta joukowski condition with the condition that the total lift should agree with the measured value, and this, in turn, completely determines the flow pattern .  practically, this is accomplished by giving a fictitious camber to the profile .  since potential flow theory is valid outside of the boundary layer, once the boundary layer thickness is known, the potential flow may be corrected for the displacement thickness and the viscous wake by appropriate source distributions .  the boundary layer cannot be evaluated, of course, until the potential flow is known and the circulation is applied .  a criterion to determine the circulation, by generalizing the kutta joukowski condition, was proposed by preston and spence by assuming that

some progress has been made in dicsovering the behaviour of a structure subjected to noise it is not possible to estimate the life of any component at the drawing board stage . some prototype strain measurements and proof testing are therefore essential if one is to prove the integrity of the design . within the structural limits of single skin construction set in this lecture the main conclusion to be reached is that no reasonable estimate of fatigue life can yet be made in the drawing board stage of a structure . nevertheless, a study of the form of behaviour of typical structures has led to a theoretical simplification of the problem of skin vibration . from this it has been possible to suggest an optimum deisgn for a skin stiffened by stringers . a suggestion for an optimum design of skin and rib for control surfaces to minimise stresses at the rib skin intersection is put forward but no experience can check this yet . the most resonable basis for the future estimation of fatigue life of a component appears to be the /random/ s n curve and consierable effort should be made to obtain the necessary test data . the life expectation of a new design will be uncertain and some proof

as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem is understood sufficiently well for design purposes . part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the surface . many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and full scale conditions . for small scale models it is, therefore, frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and connected with the occurrence of shock induced separation of the turbulent boundary layers . for both two dimensional aerofoils and straight and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a certain strength which applies for both model and full scale conditions full scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information is at present available on this point . most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady motion characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter relation between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain unsteady flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface separation . some

to the theory of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer . an approximation to the heat transfer rate across a laminar incompressible boundary layer, for arbitrary distribution of main stream

heat transfer rate to a portion of surface of length l breadth is given as where k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, o its prandtl number, p its density, u its viscosity, r(x) is the skin friction, and t(x) the excess of wall temperature over main stream temperature . a critical appraisement of the formula indicates that it should be very accurate for large, but that for of order 0.7

known transformations an expression is deducted for heat transfer to a surface, with arbitrary temperature distribution along it, and with a uniform stream outside it at arbitrary mach number (equation (42)) .  from this the temperature distribution along such a surface is deduced in the case (of importance at high mach numbers) when heat transfer to it is balanced entirely by radiation from it .  this calculation, which includes the solution of a non linear integral equation, gives higher temperatures near the nose, and lower ones farther back (figure 2), than are found from a theory which assumes the wall temperature uniform and averages the heat transfer balance .  this effect will be considerably mitigated for bodies of high thermal conductivity., the author is not in a

total drag of the forebody at three body stations body nose were also obtained . the tests were conducted at reynolds numbers of 2.13 x 10 and 7.66 x 10, based on body length . the maximum range of thrust coefficients for the small jet was from 0 to about at the lower test reynolds number, for which the boundary layer was laminar over the entire body in the jet off condition, a very small flow from the jet moved the point of transition forward to the vicinity of the 20 percent body station . as the jet flow was increased, the transition point moved abruptly to the nose at a thrust coefficient of about gardless of the type of boundary layer . at the higher test reynolds number for which the boundary layer was largely turbulent in the jet off condition the total drag, including skin friction, was reduced somewhat by the action of the jet . although the forward exhausting small jet was found to have the above favorable effects upon the drag, these findings are not believed too important since the question arises as to the benefits of the same small jet exhausting from the rear of the body in the conventional manner . no attempt was made to establish geometric optimums in the present investigation, yet, from a general consideration of the benefits indicated by the present results and the phenomena known to occur in the vicinity of rearward exhausting jets, the

by investigating an appropriate combination of flows on relative stream surfaces whose intersections with a z plane either upstream of or somewhere inside the blade row form a circular arc or a radial

the relative magnitude of the local velocity of sound and a certain combination of velocity components of the fluid . a general method to solve this equation by both hand and high speed digital
